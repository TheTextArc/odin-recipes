        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 medium onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, finely diced</li>
            <li>1 lime, juiced</li>
            <li>1/4 fresh cilantro, finely chopped</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Optional additions</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>mango, peach, plu, or pineapple</li>
            <li>Beans</li>
            <li>Corn</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If you don't want raw onions, saute the onions in a pan with a bit of water over medium heat until the water has boiled off.</li>
            <li>You can substitute cilantro with another herb if you want to.</li>
            <li>Mix the ingredients into a bowl. Add salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Taste the salsa to your liking. The salsa consists of spiciness from the peppers, sweetness from the tomatoes, and freshness from the herbs and lime.</li>
            <li>Add the appropriate ingridients as needed if you want more of a certain flavour.</li>
            <li>When storing, make sure the container is air tight. Make sure to eat as soon as possible since it won't last as long as store bought salsa.</li>
        </ol>
