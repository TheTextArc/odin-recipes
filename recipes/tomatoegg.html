            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a medium non-stick pan over medium high heat until hot. 
                Add the eggs and let them sit without touching until the bottom side is done, but the top is still raw (takes around 30 seconds). 
                Stor with a spatula, chopping the egg into bite-sized pieces until the eggs are cooked. Transfer eggs to a plate, put aside.

                Add 1/2 tablespoon of oil, green onions, and garlic to the pan. Stir a few times for fragrance.
